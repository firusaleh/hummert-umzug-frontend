## Integration with Enhanced Services

All components are integrated with the enhanced services:
- Use `api.fixed.js` for API calls
- Utilize utility functions from `utils.js`
- WebSocket integration where needed
- Context API integration

## Migration Guide

To migrate from old components to enhanced versions:

1. Update imports:
```javascript
// Old
import Modal from './components/Modal';

// New
import Modal from './components/Modal.fixed';
```

2. Update props for new features:
```javascript
// Old
<Modal isOpen={true} onClose={handleClose}>
  Content
</Modal>

// New
<Modal 
  isOpen={true} 
  onClose={handleClose}
  closeOnEscape={true}
  closeOnOverlayClick={true}
  size="md"
>
  Content
</Modal>
```

3. Update form components:
```javascript
// Old
<ClientForm client={client} />

// New
<ClientForm 
  client={client} 
  isEditing={true}
  onSuccess={handleSuccess}
  onCancel={handleCancel}
/>
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:

1. **Animations**: Add smooth transitions and animations
2. **Themes**: Expand theme support with custom color schemes
3. **Virtualization**: Add virtual scrolling for large lists
4. **PWA Features**: Offline support for forms
5. **Advanced Validation**: Complex validation rules
6. **Component Library**: Create a Storybook instance

## Best Practices

When using these components:

1. Always provide proper error boundaries
