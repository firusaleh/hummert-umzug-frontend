## Security Improvements

1. **No More Sensitive Data Logging**
   - All console.log statements with auth data removed
   - Error messages no longer expose sensitive information

2. **Enhanced Password Security**
   - Password requirements increased from 6 to 12 characters
   - Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Validation regex: `/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{12,}$/`

3. **Input Sanitization**
   - Added string sanitization in UmzuegeList
   - Created utils for safe string handling

4. **Hardcoded Data Removal**
   - Removed hardcoded email addresses
   - Removed hardcoded URLs (handled in services layer)

## Error Handling Improvements

1. **Try-Catch Blocks Added**
   - All async operations wrapped in try-catch
   - User-friendly error messages displayed
   - No stack traces exposed to users

2. **Loading States**
   - Proper loading indicators for all async operations
   - Disabled form inputs during loading
   - Visual feedback for user actions

3. **Error Boundaries**
   - Component-level error handling
   - Graceful fallback UI for errors

## Accessibility Improvements

1. **ARIA Labels**
   - All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
   - Form fields properly labeled
   - Status indicators have role attributes

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - All interactive elements keyboard accessible
   - Focus states properly managed
   - Tab order logical

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Modern JavaScript**
   - UseCallback hooks for performance
   - Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
   - Async/await instead of promises

2. **Component Structure**
   - Smaller, focused components
   - Reusable status badges
   - Consistent naming conventions

3. **Type Safety**
   - PropTypes could be added (future improvement)

- Storage utilities

## Next Steps

1. Add TypeScript for better type safety
2. Implement comprehensive unit tests
3. Add E2E tests for critical user flows
4. Consider adding React Error Boundaries
5. Implement proper logging service
6. Add performance monitoring
