# Frontend Dependency Fixes Update

## Date: 19.5.2025

### Summary

The frontend dependencies were verified and fixed to ensure all necessary packages are installed. Additionally, code improvements were made to address linting warnings.

### Verification Results

1. **All Required Dependencies Are Installed**:
   - `date-fns` - ✅ Installed (v3.6.0)
   - `dompurify` - ✅ Installed (v3.2.6)
   - `socket.io-client` - ✅ Installed (v4.8.1)
   - All other required packages are properly installed

2. **No Missing Dependencies Were Found**:
   - The application is using custom implementations for:
     - Infinite scrolling (using Intersection Observer API)
     - Form validation (custom implementation)
     - Localization (simple language selection without an i18n library)

### Code Improvements Made

1. **Fixed utils.js Linting Warnings**:
   - Removed unused imports:
     ```javascript
     // From:
     import { parseISO, format, formatDistance, subDays } from 'date-fns';
     
     // To:
     import { format, formatDistance } from 'date-fns';
     ```

   - Fixed anonymous default export warning:
     ```javascript
     // From:
     export default {
       date: dateUtils,
       number: numberUtils,
       // ...
     };
     
     // To:
     const utils = {
       date: dateUtils,
       number: numberUtils,
       // ...
     };
     
     export default utils;
     ```

### Verification Steps

To verify all dependencies are correctly installed, run:
```bash
npm list date-fns dompurify socket.io-client
```

To check for any remaining linting issues, run:
```bash
npx eslint src
```

### Next Steps

The frontend now has all required dependencies and fixed linting warnings. The application is ready for deployment or further development.

### Notes

- No third-party form validation libraries (like Formik or React Hook Form) are in use
- No internationalization libraries (like i18next) are in use
- No infinite scroll libraries are in use (custom implementation with Intersection Observer)
- All components use React 18 best practices
